## üß† Interview-Ready Explanations

- **Why is it client-side only?**  
  It avoids privacy concerns by doing all conversions in-browser using JS libraries. No file is uploaded to any server.

- **Why async/await?**  
  Many file processing operations (like reading PDFs or rendering with html2canvas) are asynchronous, so `async/await` makes the code cleaner and easier to debug.

- **What libraries are used for conversion?**  
  - `PDF-Lib` for creating PDFs.
  - `html2canvas` for rendering HTML into image for export.
  - `pdf.js` for rendering PDF pages.
  - `Mammoth.js` to read DOCX files as HTML.
  - `xlsx` (SheetJS) to render Excel files as HTML.
